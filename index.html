		<div id="div1">
			<p>Question 2: Most of the var styles are emtpy, have no colour, are "nulls", and have no data. It basically contains "nothing" from what I can see. The conditional statement is making the map have some visual features and it is returning empty white, dots with opacity so we can see through them. 
			<p>Question 3: Changing the colour instead of "#fff"
			<p>Question 4: Feature is the geojson metadata for that specfic feature which inclused the properties and geometry. Layer is the representation of those features on the map.  
			<P>Question 5: layer.options.fill bascially defines the colour of different fill-related options, as for layer.getLatLng(), this returns the center point lat and long coordinates of the layer. 
			<p>Question 6: When i reloaded the page, the big black circles got much bigger and lost their fill colours. The map was engulfed by this basically.
